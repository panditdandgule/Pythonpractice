# John has recently learned about ASCII values. With his knowledge of ASCII values and character he has
# developed a special word and named it John's Magical word.
#
# A word which consists of alphabets whose ASCII values is a prime number is a John's Magical word. An
# alphabet is john's Magical alphabet if its ASCII value is prime.
#
# John's nature is to boast about the things he know or have learnt about. So just to defame his friends he
# gives few string to his friends and ask them to convert it to John's Magical word. None of his friends would
# like to get insulted. Help them to convert the given strings to John's Magical Word.
#
# Rules for converting:
#
# 1.Each character should be replaced by the nearest John's Magical alphabet.
#
# 2.If the character is equidistant with 2 Magical alphabets. The one with lower ASCII value will be considered as its replacement.
#
# Input format:
#
# First line of input contains an integer T number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer N (denoting the length of the string) and a string S.
#
# Output Format:
#
# For each test case, print John's Magical Word in a new line.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= T <= 100
#
# 1 <= |S| <= 500
#
# SAMPLE INPUT
# 1
# 8
# KINGKONG
#
# SAMPLE OUTPUT
# IIOGIOOG
