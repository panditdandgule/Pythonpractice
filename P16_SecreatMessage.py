# X and Y are best friends and they love to chat with each other. But their recent concerns about the privacy
# of their messages has distant them. So they decided to encrypt their messages with a key, K, such that the
# character of their messages are now shifted K times towards right of their initial value. Their techniques
# only convert numbers and alphabets while leaving special characters as it is.
#
# Provided the value K you are required to encrypt the messages using their idea of encryption.
#
# INPUT FORMAT
#
# The first line of the input contains, T, the number of messages. The next line contains N, and K, no of
# characters in the message and key for encryption. The next line contains the message.
#
# OUTPUT FORMAT
#
# Output the encrypted messages on a new line for all the test cases.
#
# CONSTRAINS

# 1≤T≤100
# 1≤N≤106
