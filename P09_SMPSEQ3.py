# You are given a sorted sequence of n integers S = s1, s2, ..., sn and a sorted sequence of m integers Q = q1, q2, ..., qm.
# Please, print in the ascending order all such si that does not belong to Q.

# Input data specification
#
# In the first line you are given one integer 2<=n<=100, and in the following line n integers:
# -100 <= si <= 100, si <= si+1.
#
# In the third line you are given one integer 2<=m<=100, and in the following line m integers:
# -100 <= qi <= 100, qi <= qi+1.

# The sequence of requested integers separated by spaces.

# Example
#
# Input:
# 5
# -2 -1 0 1 4
# 6
# -3 -2 -1 1 2 3
# Output:
# 0 4
