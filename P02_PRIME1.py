# Peter wants to generate some prime numbers for his cryptosystem. Help him! Your task is to generate all prime numbers
# between two given numbers!
#
# Input
#
# The input begins with the number t of test cases in a single line (t<=10). In each of the next t lines there are two
# numbers m and n (1 <= m <= n <= 1000000000, n-m<=100000) separated by a space.
#
# Output
#
# For every test case print all prime numbers p such that m <= p <= n, one number per line, test cases separated by an
# empty line.
#
# Example
#
# Input:
# 2
# 1 10
# 3 5
#
# Output:
# 2
# 3
# 5
# 7
#
# 3
# 5
# Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages (though most should be OK if the algorithm is well
# designed)
