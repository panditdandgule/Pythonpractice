# Manish has got the task to frame a speech for his professor at the university at the Annual sports meet.But
# the problem is that the professor has speech dyslexia and he can't speak the words clearly which have vowels
# in them. So Manish has to avoid such words and has to minimise their usage in the speech letter. Your task
# is to help Manish mark the vowels in the words so that he can minimise their use. You are given a string S
# consisting of lower case letters only. You need to count the number of vowels in the string S.
#
# INPUT The first line will contain an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The following T lines
# will contain a string S in lower case letters only.
#
# OUTPUT Print the number the vowels in the string S.
#
# CONSTRAINTS 1<=T<=100
#
# SAMPLE INPUT
# 1
# hashes
#
# SAMPLE OUTPUT
# 2
