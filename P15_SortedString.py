# Little Ashish got a lot of strings as his birthday gift. He does not mind getting so many strings for
# free; in fact, he loves them. But, on noticing all the strings he received as a gift, Little Ashish, who's
# also a snob and a bit OCD kind of a guy, realizes that he does not like the way in which the strings are
# arranged.
#
# He likes his strings sorted, in a different kind of a way. He wants his strings to be sorted based on the
# count of characters present in the string. For instance, if the string is: "aaabbc", then the desired
# string would be: cbbaaa. In case where the count of two characters is same, then the lexicographically
# smaller one will be printed first. For instance: "aabbcc" then, the output will be: "aabbcc".
#
# Input:
# First line of input contains number of test cases T. Each test case contains a single string S.
#
# Output:
# For each test cases print the sorted string.
#
# Constraints:
# 1<=T<=100
# 1<=|S|<=100
#
# Note:
# String contains only lowercase characters ['a' to 'z'].
#
# SAMPLE INPUT
# 3
# aabbccdd
# aabcc
# hackerearth
#
# SAMPLE OUTPUT
# aabbccdd
# baacc
# cktaaeehhrr
