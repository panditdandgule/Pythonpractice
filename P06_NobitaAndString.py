# Doraemon gave Nobita a gadget that swaps words inside a string in the following manner :
#
# If there are W words, word 1 is swapped with word W, word 2 is swapped with word W-1 and so on. The
# problem is that Nobita himself cannot verify the answer for large strings. Help him write a program to do so.
#
# INPUT :
# the first line of the input contains the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line
# containing the string.
#
# OUTPUT :
# output the string with the words swapped as stated above.
#
# CONSTRAINTS :
# |string length| <= 100000
# string contains english alphabets and spaces
#
# SAMPLE INPUT
# 1
# hello world
#
# SAMPLE OUTPUT
# world hello

for _ in range(int(input())):
    string=input().split()
