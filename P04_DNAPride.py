# Everyone is familiar with Pratik's obsession with DNA and how much he likes to find the correct pair for
# the nucleotide bases. One day Samim found him exaggerating about his knowledge of DNA bases. So Samim
# challenged Pratik about finding the correct base pair for the given DNA sequence and show the result.
# Also he secretly introduced some of RNA nucleotide bases to test Pratik. Now initially he accepted the
# challenge but soon found out about how big the sequence actually was, so he came to you ask him for your
# in finding the sequence and keep his pride about the knowledge of DNA molecules.
#
# You are given a string that contains the nucleotide bases of DNA and RNA, you are needed to find the
# correct pair for all the bases and print the corresponding sequence obtained. In case the sequence
# contains a RNA base, print "Error RNA nucleobases found!" (without quotes).
#
# INPUT FORMAT
#
# The first line of input contains T, the no of test cases. The next line of input contains N, the no of
# bases in each of the DNA sequence The line after that contains the DNA sequence.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
#
# For each test case output your answer on a new line.
