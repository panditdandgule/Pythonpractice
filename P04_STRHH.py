# Given a sequence of 2*k characters, please print every second character from the first half of the sequence. Start
# printing with the first character.
#
# Input
#
# In the first line of input your are given the positive integer t (1<=t<=100) - the number of test cases. In the each of the next t lines, you are given a sequence of 2*k (1<=k<=100) characters.
#
# Output
#
# For each of the test cases please please print every second character from the first half of a given sequence
# (the first character should appear).
